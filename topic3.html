<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Do it yourself in the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>B. 1. The story ‘Taro’s Reward’ shows that Taro is thoughtful, hardworking and</strong><br>
<strong> also wise. Read aloud the parts of story that show these qualities in Taro.</strong><br>
<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;(i )…. for he was a thoughtful son and wanted to give his old parents everything they needed. (Para 1)<br>
(ii)Though he worked very hard, he earned very little money. (Para 1)<br>
(iii)But Taro had been wise enough to slip behind a rock…………….. (Para 11)</p>
<p><strong>2. (i) Like Patrick in the story ‘Who did Patrick’s Homework’, Taro is helped bymagic. Do you believe in magic? What are the magical things that happen in these stories?</strong><br>
<strong>Ans.</strong> My parents say there is no such thing as magic. It is all a matter of playing tricks. But I agree with the elders only partly. Magic is not all sleight of hand or mesmerism. There is some supernatural agency that carries out the tricks.</p>
<p>In the case of Patrick, there was an elf or small man. He was not one like us. In the case of Taro, there appears a waterfall behind the rocks. Secondly, its water tasted like sake. These were magical things.</p>
<p><strong>(ii) Which story do you like better, and why? Do you know such stories in other languages? Discuss these questions in class.</strong><br>
<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Truly speaking, I like both the stories because both are interesting and educative. Secondly, both have a touch of magic. Still, Patrick’s story is better than Taro’s. Patrick learns to do homework unknowingly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Now write a paragraph or two about these two stories, comparing them.</strong><br>
<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Who did Patrick’s Homework is, in my opinion, better than ‘Taro’s Reward.’. Patrick hated homework. He played hockey and basketball instead. This was something quite natural. All children find doing homework boring and dull. Taro, on the other hand, was a thoughtful, wise and hardworking boy. He was just the opposite of Patrick. Even God favours and rewards such a boy. A magical waterfall gave him an intoxicating drink for his old father. Both the stories teach us lessons.</p>
<p><strong>C. 1.Listen to these children. What are they talking about?</strong><br>
