<ul>
<li>where it is &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• what you do there &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• why you like it</li>
</ul>
<p>You may instead write about a place you dislike or are afraid of.</p>

<p>My favourite place in the house is either the balcony or the cemented platform built round the stem of the peepal tree. I use to sit in the balcony to enjoy the sunshine on winter days and the cool breeze on summer mornings. I learn my lessons and even do my homework there. I like it because it is an isolated, quiet and open place.</p>
