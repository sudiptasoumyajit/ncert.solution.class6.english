<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Writing (Page 53)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>A. Do you have a ‘dream’ or something you very much wish to do? Write a para&shy;graph saying what you want or wish to do. Then say (in another paragraph) how you think you can make your dream come true.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Dreaming is a common and natural activity of the mind when we are asleep. But the word ‘dream’ also means ambition, a keen desire in life. In that sense, I have a modest dream. I wish to qualify for the medical profession. To me, a doctor ranks next to God as protector of life. He provides relief to the crying patients. He cures diseases. He helps a patient recover from illness, and be happy and live a full life. I wish to be a doctor to help the poor patients, to bring a smile on their faces.</p>
<p>I know that my dream is not easy to realise. I need not only a brilliant mind but also the means to pay for my studies. Nevertheless, I am determined to pursue my goal. I hope to do well in the entrance examination. As for the financial help, I will get it from some bank.</p>
<p><strong>2. Given below are some words that are spelt differently in British and American English. Fill in the blanks accordingly.</strong><br>
