<p><strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Let’s go for a little walk. Only you must tell me about things. I shall be so glad when today is over. The other bad days can’t be half as bad as this.

<p><strong>B. Answer the following questions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Why do you think the writer visited Miss Beam’s school? (1)</strong><br>
<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;The writer had heard much about Miss Beam’s new teaching method. So he visited her school to see the new play-way method personally.</p>
<p><strong>2. What was the ‘game’ that every child in the school had to play? (9)</strong><br>
<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;Every child in the school had to play the role of being blind, deaf, dumb, injured and lame once in a term. It was a sort of game and training.</p>
<p><strong>3. “Each term every child has one blind day, one lame day …”. Complete the line. Which day was the hardest? Why was it the hardest? (9, 11, 15)</strong><br>
<strong>Ans:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;“… one injured day and one dumb day.” Being blind was the hardest day. The student felt that he/she was going to be hit by something every moment.</p>
<p><strong>4. What was the purpose of these special days? (5, 9)</strong><br>
<strong>Ans:</strong>&nbsp;The purpose of these special days was to give the children a personal taste of misfortune. They learnt to help the needy in society. Such training made them good citizens.</p>
