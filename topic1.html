<p><strong>1. In the story, Patrick does difficult things he hates to do because the elf pre&shy;tends he needs help. Have you ever done something difficult or frightening, by pretending about it in some way? Tell your classmates about it.</strong><br>
<strong>Or</strong><br>
<strong>Say what you feel about homework. (The words and phrases in the boxes may help you.) Do you think it is useful, even though you may not like it? Form pairs, and speak to each other.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong><br>
You may say, “I am not fond of homework.”<br>
Your partner may reply, “But my sister helps me with my lessons at home, and that gives a boost to my marks.”<br>
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(not) be fond of &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (not) take to &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(not) develop a liking for</strong><br>

<strong>1.</strong> I am not very fond of keeping my room clean and tidy.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> But my sister does all this for me.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> I have not developed a liking for non-veg.<br>

<p><strong>Writing &nbsp;(Page 13)</strong><br>
<strong>A. This story has a lot of rhyming words, as a poem does. Can you write out some parts of it like a poem, so that the rhymes come at the end of separate lines? For example:</strong><br>
Patrick never did homework. ‘Too boring”, he said.<br>
He played baseball and Hockey and Nintendo instead.<br>
<strong>Ans.</strong> The man of the tiniest size<br>
was true to his word and wise<br>
Patrick saved the elf from the cat<br>
The elf promised to do all that<br>
Patrick loved sports and hated homework<br>
He wasted his time and studies shirk</p>
<p><strong>B. Look at these sentences.</strong><br>
1.‘Too boring,” he said.<br>
2. Cleaned his room, did his chores.<br>
When we speak we often leave out words that can easily be guessed.<br>
We do not do this when we write unless we are trying to write as we speak (as in the story).<br>
So, if we were to write carefully, we would say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homework is too boring, he said.</li>
<li>He cleaned his room and did his chores.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C. Rewrite the following incomplete sentences carefully, so that the reader does not have to guess what is left out.</strong><br>
1.more and more books.<br>
2.too difficult.<br>
3.got up late, missed the bus.<br>
4.solved the mystery.</p>
<p><strong>Ans:</strong><br>
1. The writers and poets read more and more books.<br>
2. This personal question is too difficult to answer.<br>
3. When I got up late yesterday morning, I missed the school bus.<br>
4. Lord Krishna solved the mystery of life after .death.</p>
<p><strong>D. Look at this cartoon by R. K. Laxman. Read the sentence given below the cartoon. Discuss the following questions with your partner.</strong><br>

<ul>
<li>What is it about?</li>
<li>Do you find it funny? If so, why?</li>
<li>Do you think a cartoon is a serious drawing? Why or why not?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ans:</strong></p>
<p>1. It is about a father’s concern for the betterment of his child.<br>
2. Yes, the cartoon is really funny. Father orders the child to labour (to work hard) with his studies. But he forbids the boy to read the laws against child labour.<br>
3. A cartoon is chiefly meant to make us laugh.<br>
It is also a serious drawing in one sense.<br>
It draws our attention to some problem that affects us all.</p>
