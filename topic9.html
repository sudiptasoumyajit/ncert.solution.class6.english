<p><strong>Imagine you are journeying through a desert. Write a couple of paragraphs describing what you see and hear.</strong><br>
<strong>Ans.</strong> A desert is not a place worth living. It is a nightmare to journey through the Thar Desert. From my personal experience, I know how hot the deserts are. I saw the end&shy;less expanse of sand and sand dunes. Only here and there I saw a few thorny bushes. There are very few birds. The camel is a common sight. There are only small villages around oases. Life is very hard there. Water is scarce, so is green&shy;ery.<br>
We hear the blowing of hot winds and the howling of sandstorms. We can hear the calling of mongooses and the howling of jackals. Now and then we can hear the tinkling of bells around the neck of camels.</p>
